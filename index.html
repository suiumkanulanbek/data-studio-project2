            <h1>Is an Expensive Journalism Degree Worth the Investment?</h1>
            <p class="subhead">A degree from Columbia Journalism School comes with high tuition fees, yet the average annual salary for journalists 
                in the U.S. is significantly lower than that of other MS schools with similar or even lower educational costs.</p>

            <p>The thrill of acceptance to Columbia Journalism School's prestigious MS program quickly gives way to financial anxiety for many aspiring journalists. 
            As digital confetti falls on acceptance portals, students face the sobering reality of a $78,300 tuition bill and an estimated $120,000 in total costs.</p>
            
            <p>For Stephanie, a 2024 admit, the decision to pursue her dream came with a hefty price tag. 
            "I always knew that going to this university is expensive because of its name in New York," she explains.
            "I couldn't afford it but still decided to come here because of its brand." Like many of her peers, Stephanie took out a $120,000 federal loan to finance her education.</p>

            <p>The financial burden isn't unique to journalism. Jesse, an aspiring lawyer, faces similar costs for his LLM degree in the same school, with tuition around $81,000 
            and a total estimated cost of $120,000. However, the long-term financial implications differ significantly between the two fields.</p>
           
            <p>Journalism graduates may take <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-time-to-repay-student-loans#:~:text=Report%20Highlights.,years%20to%20repay%20student%20loans."> twice as long</a>  to repay their loans compared to their law school counterparts, 
            given the stark difference in median salaries between the two professions. This raises questions about the return on investment 
            for high-cost journalism programs.</p>

            <p>Columbia's MS in Journalism stands out as one of the university's most expensive programs, rivaling costs of STEM degrees. 
            Notably, a Computer Science degree from Columbia's School of Engineering costs approximately $20,000 less than the journalism program.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>As students like Stephanie pin their hopes on Columbia's brand opening doors in New York's competitive media landscape, 
                the question remains: Will the prestigious degree justify the financial investment in an industry known for 
                its challenging job market and modest starting salaries?</p>

            <p>The financial outlook for journalism graduates doesn't quite match the big investment in their education. 
                With a median annual income of $68,160 for reporters and journalists, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat39.htm  "> U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, 
                the road to financial stability post-graduation appears lengthy and exhausting path.</p> 

            <p>An analysis on median annual income and US Federal loan conditions shows  that a journalism graduate with $120,000 in student debt could spend nearly two decades repaying their 
                loans if they pay 20 percent of their salary. While law graduates earning an average of $120,000 annually might clear their 
                debt in under seven years by allocating 20 percent of their income, their journalism friends face a 17-year, 8-month repayment journey.</p>

            <p>However, these projections often come optimistic. The <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2019/11/student-loan-system-presents-repayment-challenges"> The Pew Research Center</a> reveals the complex reality of student loan repayment in the U.S. 
                Despite standard plans designed for a 10-year payoff, many borrowers encounter significant hardships. A study of students who began college 
                in 2003-04 found that 12 years later, 21 percent had sought economic hardship deferments, while an alarming 28 percent had defaulted on their 
                loans.</p>
                
            <p>The repayment struggle extends beyond these figures, with many borrowers facing delinquencies due to missed payments. Such financial strain 
                implies concerns over financial prospects of journalism graduates, raising questions about the value of high-cost journalism programs.</p>
